# cra-template-imaginelearning

The official Imagine Learning template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Based off of the [official Redux+TS template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux-typescript).

Includes [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/),
[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), and
[Redux Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/).

To use this template, add `--template imaginelearning` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template imaginelearning

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template imaginelearning
```

This template uses public packages hosted through [GitHub Package Registry (GPR)](https://github.com/features/packages).
Currently, [GPR requires an acces token](https://github.community/t/download-from-github-package-registry-without-authentication/14407)
even if the packages are publicly available. Be sure you've properly
[configured npm or Yarn with your personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages)
before using this template.
